# kates-travels

Running on heroku at [http://kates-travel.herokuapp.com/](http://kates-travel.herokuapp.com/)

Used a [codrops gallery demo](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/08/02/animated-responsive-image-grid/) and the twitter api to get and display all photos in tweets using #katestraveldiaries.

Although it doesn't automatically update the client, it uses the Streaming API to receive any new tweets after the server was started.
